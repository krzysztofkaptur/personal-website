As I'm unemployed now and have a lot of free time so I decided to build a shit ton of projects and publish them online, plus write about it here.

Here's the first one. Simple fake JSON API inspired by <a href="https://fakestoreapi.com" target="_blank" className="text-primary">Fake store API</a>.

"Very fancy" stack - ExpressJS, Drizzle/SQLite, Linode.
Front-end is written in EJS and to be honest, it sucks. I'm used to React/Vue and getting back into html world is not pleasant. For this project it's enough but I can imagine working like that in some big codebase would be pain in the ass. But there's also a positive. If you want something quick and don't need to pass data around that much then it's much simpler to build/deploy than going with separate front-end app.

The current state is just the beginning. I need to prioritize adding new endpoints with more data. Things like 'users' and 'testimonials' are gonna be deployed soon.

After that I'll need to take care of codebase quality. Add tests, Docker and for sure AUTOMATION. Right now it's hosted on Linode and to update it I need to go the server, pull the changes from repo and estart the pm2. So adding Github Actions is high on my todo list.

Feel free to use it <a href="https://cyrus-api.com" target='_blank' className="text-primary">here</a>, or clone it and use locally. Do whatever and have fun. Cya
